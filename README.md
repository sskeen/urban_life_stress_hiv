# Law enforcement–related stress and gentrification as determinants of CD4 decline

*_Description:_* With the second-highest indicator of income inequality (U.S. Gini coefficient), a violent crime rate 5 times the national average, and 19% of families, statewide, unable to meet subsistence costs, contemporary Orleans Parish exemplifies the “structural pathogenesis” of racially polarized economic inequality. _Embodiment_, a key tenet of Krieger’s ecosocial theory,[^1] recognizes the within-person sequalae of discrimination and societal maldistributions of political and economic capital. Environmental stressors, particular to contexts of entrenched inequity, represent a key pathway by which inequality may be embodied via trauma cognitions, alcohol misuse, and immune dysfunction among Black people living with HIV (PWH) in Greater New Orleans.

This ongoing secondary analysis integrates exploratory factor analyses and multilevel mixed-effects models presented in the "Embodying Oppression: Urban Stress as Structural Pathogenesis among People Living with HIV in the Gulf South" symposium,[^2] delivered at the 2024 Society of Behavioral Medicine 45<sup>th</sup> Annual Meeting & Scientific Sessions:
